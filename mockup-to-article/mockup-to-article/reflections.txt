You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

	*I've learned how to use basic html objects and create simple websites.
	*So far everything was pretty easy.
	*Nothing was difficult, although maybe it even seemed too easy, since I overlooked some things in the mockup website.
	*I didn't encounter any problems so far, but I used extensively the skill of looking up the right html syntax.
